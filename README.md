> A python script to automatically record gameplays using OBS. The script will also auto-delete recorded gameplays older than 3 days, so the disk space doesn't get overwhelmed.

## Usage

* Open OBS, head over to settings and set the hotkey for "Start Recording" to Alt+Page Up.

* Then, set the hotkey for "Stop Recording" to Alt+Page Down.

* Set OBS to always start at windows startup.

* Set the directories for the following in helpers.py dateFile, videoFilePath, bakkesMod.

* Open config.py and add the .exe filename for the game you would like to enable recording for.

* Finally, set this python command to execute at startup using a .bat file or Windows Task SCheduler.


```sh
python Auto_OBS_Recorder.py
```
